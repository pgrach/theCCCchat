1) INGESTION phase: to collect PDF links from the CCC publications website storing them in a SQLite database

Scraping script: To collect all the PDF URLs from the website:
 - Scrape the main publications page to collect links to individual publication pages.
 - Visit each publication page to find and collect links to PDFs.
 - find the links to PDFs using the collected links and store them in SQLite links.db 
 
INGESTION successfully completed: 1321 links stored in SQLite db.

future improvements:
- deal with non-PDF publications, using UnstructuredHTMLLoader;
- add weekly schedule for scrapping new publications

2) PROCESSING phase:

- Analyze the scope: created size.py. 1942.27 MB, www.theccc.org.uk: 1267 unique links
- Breaking Down PDFs utilizing Langchain's PyPDFLoader into smaller text segments
- Create semantic embeddings for the text segments utilizing OpenAI embeddings
- Efficient Storage and Retrieval utilizing Pinecone
